exchange2ical

about:
exchange2ical extracts a public folder calendar from OWA2003 and generates a ics file from the data.
the extraction highly depends on how events are added to OWA2003 and might need to be changed for your use case.

dependencies: 
  - python2 (tested with 2.7)
  - beautiful-soup
  - python2-icalendar
  - python2-pytz

optional:
  - any webserver
  - any cron daemon

install process:
 1) copy exchange2icalrc-sample to either /etc/exchange2icalrc or $HOME/.exchange2ical/exchange2icalrc (prioritised)
 2) adjust config to your needs
 3) add a cron job (eg. */30 * * * * /path/to/exchange2ical)

additional steps when using a webserver:
 1) create a user (for example: exchange)
 2) setup a directory within webserver-root (for example: /var/http/cal)
 3) chown exchange:http /var/http/cal
 4) chmod 2750 /var/http/cal
 5) see 'install process' above
